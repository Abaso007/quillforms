A new revolution in WordPress forms and surveys.

== Description ==
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqWv-WD-S88

Contact forms and surveys act as lead generation machines and bridge the gap between your audience and products.
But are people motivated to answer all the questions when you ask them?
Not if they feel overwhelmed.

That’s why we created QuillForms.

Quill Forms plugin is free Typeform alternative for WordPress.

With QuillForms Wordpress plugin, you can build surveys that seem less like a game of 20 questions and more like a casual conversation.
By asking one question at a time in a friendly tone, you nudge the respondents to complete the desired forms and boost your conversion rate.
What’s more, QuillForms offers loads of hip features that make creating forms as much fun as filling them!
·  Drag and drop question types
·  Humanize your conversation
·  Personalize your themes
·  Change font, colors and backgrounds with a single click
Moreover, QuillForms free version comes with variety of blocks:
1- Welcome screen block
2- Date block
3- Email block
4- Dropdown block
5- Multiple choice block
6- Statement block
7- Website block
8- Short text block
9- Long text block
10- Default thank you screen
